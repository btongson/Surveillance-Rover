## FUTURE SCOPE
1.The most important use of this project will be for surveillance. </br>
2.It can be used to infiltrate at various locations where it would be hard for a human to infiltrate without getting noticed.  
3.Can be used for household surveillance.  
4.Can be used by traffic security to assess fast moving cars.  
5. A drone can be detected using radar system whereas it is hard for a land rover to be detected while it is moving on land.  
6.Can be used to hijacked areas/buildings.  
7.Can be used under a tunnel with an introduction of sensors like gas and pollution sensor. </br>
